## Key Features:

Separate Queues: Divides processes into high and low priority queues.
Burst Time Sorting: Arranges processes within each queue based on burst time.
Clear Structure: Well-organized code with comments for understanding.
Getting Started:

## Clone the repository.
Compile using a C compiler (e.g., gcc multi_level_queue.c -o multi_level_queue).
Run and provide process details interactively.

## Learn More:

Examine the code to grasp logic and scheduling mechanisms.
Experiment with different process priorities and burst times.
This project provides hands-on experience with multi-level queue scheduling!
